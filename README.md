## Peer-To-Peer Live Media Watching Video Chat 
**LiveView Features:**
- Low Latency Peer-to-Peer connections.

The motivation behind this project was to create a video chat application that allowed users to consume synchronized media together over the internet. With LiveView the video playback comes from the host's display so users can enjoy media from whatever site that they wish to use including YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ etc. and aren't limited to a single platform. The use of Peer-to-Peer connections provides low latency allowing users to enjoy synchronized video playback, an integrated text chat box and audio/video streams creating the optimal watching experience.
